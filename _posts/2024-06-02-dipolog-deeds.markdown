I apologize since I haven't posted in a long while.

A while back, I made plans to meet someone from a dating app (it's called Bumble, by the way). She agreed to see me after her graduation so as not to alarm her parents and siblings. Fast forward a few days and we eventually met up, thanks to the economic will of my parents. However, I still have to pay them back every salary until I completely pay off my debt.

I was very sweaty and tired-looking at that time because I had been sweating like hell from all the anxiety and nervousness. After all, this was my first time meeting someone who is a step above me. I wore my trusted utility vest and my Fila shorts to complete that ultimate utility drip that I've been wanting to wear forever. We met at the hotel lobby, which is also a restaurant, but unfortunately, it was fully booked, so we had to find another place to eat; she didn't like the food where we ate, though. We went to different places, mostly just the arcade since it's the only place she knew where we could have fun. I took some pictures, and while my friends' reactions were very positive, there was one friend that had a different reaction and gave me a different perspective, which I'll talk about more below.

At first, I wasn't sure if it was already considered a date since it neither had the descriptions of a date nor a casual hangout. Though it's up for debate, she just told me I could call it whatever I wanted. Let's just let my delusion slide for now and call this one a date.

We spent most of our time in CityMall. We went to the arcade, and I lost to a game of hoops, but at least I beat her in a Tekken clone. We went to the boulevard and ate doughnuts. We talked for a bit about our lore and history. I decided we take a stroll again near the shoreline. I kinda wanted to ask her to hold her hand, but the fear of getting turned down got the best of me, so I just remained walking at a decent distance (not too far nor too close). We then sat down on one of the benches and did another lore and history dump about our past, but mostly my past since she kept most of hers to herself.

After the "date" was over, I initially decided to eat dinner at the hotel lobby, but then my parents intervened, and we had to cut the dinner short. I just bought her chocolates instead, choosing the ones I used to eat back when I was still down and depressed. We parted ways after that.

I had fun with the "date," even if it was just for a short while. She reinvigorated some of the things I used to enjoy, like simply having fun. I think it is safe to say that I like her now.

Back to my friend who had a different perspective. For history and context, his name is James. We've been friends since college and we work at the same company. James and I go way back with dating apps, and we even formulated a thought process known as the "James-Eli Dating Procedures." We still have a document of it somewhere, but I'm pretty sure it's gone now. The dating procedure includes a few things to ensure that the date, whether found by accident or meticulously planned, will hopefully yield better results and prevent it from leaving a bad taste in our mouths if it goes south.

The dating procedure includes numerous things like:

* **Active OSINT**

  * Actively collecting information from our date from all her public accounts and deducing the possible outcome of our date.

* **Passive OSINT**

  * Similar to Active OSINT but with a more lenient set of rules (e.g., getting likes and dislikes, simple biography lookup, etc.).

* **Ghost Clock**

  * Otherwise known as a Death Clock, it's a defense mechanism that we devised to prevent further emotional and mental damages whenever our date goes south or not the way we planned. It's basically a clock/timer that tells us to move on.

* **Sentiment Analysis**

  * Back when AI was still not that widely known, we manually did most of our sentiment analysis by hand. It helps track the emotions and patterns of behavior of our dates, keeping us well-informed on what to do if we ever notice a change in pattern or behavior.

There's more to it than those listed, but to keep it well within the topic, I just added the first four procedures so it doesn't stray too much from the point of the post.

Okay, so I asked my friend James to do the dating procedures for me since he's not using any dating apps anymore. I made him in charge of keeping data about my last (and hopefully perfect) date, so that I could make well-informed decisions on what to do next. Let's just say he found some pretty interesting insights based on the data that I gave him. Then it hit me.... \[REDACTED by James Patrick\]

Actually, fuck it. I'm gonna be blunt about all of this. \[REDACT NAPUD\]
